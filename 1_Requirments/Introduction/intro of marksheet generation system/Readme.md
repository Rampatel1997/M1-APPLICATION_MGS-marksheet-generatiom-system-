MARKSHEET GENERATION SYSTEM

In the current mark sheet generation system, the University has to spend much time just to arrange the copies of the students.
While, after arranging they have to spend the time to get the copies checked and then they produce the result. 
All this process only consume time and require huge manpower. Each year there is news about some University that copies have not checked correctly. 
The money that a University spend is large, but the result which comes is not up to the mark and because of this they need some system which can reduce all the problem and can provide the best output.

PROPOSED SYSTEM

The mark sheet generation system will reduce the time to create the marks card of the student.
The University only needs to upload the exam copies to the system and then the system will complete rest of the work.
This application can check all the papers and can produce the result. 
The computers are much faster than the human, and hence it will take less time to produce the result.
The University management can also change the procedure to produce the result if they want.
The  mark sheet generation system will not only reduce the time but it will also reduce the cost as the number of the person require is less.
